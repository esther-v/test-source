## technical test - Source

I spent 3h15 on the test.
I lost time on task 2, I wanted to add data in localStorage, get the data from there to be able to delete a movie but it didn't look clean so I delete and passed to task 3.
I also wanted to cut the scss in different parts but had no time. And although I had coded in TypeScript with React, I am more accustomed with Js components so I prefered to create JS components.
